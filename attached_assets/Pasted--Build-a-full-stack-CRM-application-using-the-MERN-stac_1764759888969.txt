🚀 Build a full-stack CRM application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This app must allow login using the built-in Replit Auth system. After login, each user should only see their own customer data (multi-tenant SaaS style).

---------------------------------------
📌 CORE REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------------------

1️⃣ Authentication
- Use Replit Auth (do NOT build your own auth).
- When a user logs in, store their user ID.
- All database records must be linked to the authenticated user.

2️⃣ CRM Module
Create CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing Customers with following fields:

- Customer Name (text)
- Email (text)
- Phone (text)
- Company (optional)
- Status (Lead, Active, Inactive)

Validation:
- Email must be unique per user.

3️⃣ Database (MongoDB or Replit DB if Mongo unavailable)
- Each customer record must include:  
  {
     name,
     email,
     phone,
     company,
     status,
     userId (from Replit Auth),
     createdAt,
     updatedAt
  }

4️⃣ Backend (Express.js)
- REST API routes:
  - POST /api/customers
  - GET /api/customers
  - GET /api/customers/:id
  - PUT /api/customers/:id
  - DELETE /api/customers/:id

- Middleware to protect routes based on logged-in user.

5️⃣ Frontend (React)
- Pages:
  🔹 Login Page (auto redirect using Replit Auth)
  🔹 Dashboard
  🔹 Customer List page
  🔹 Add/Edit Customer form

- Use Material UI OR Tailwind for styling.

- CRUD UI Requirements:
  - Users must be able to add customers via a form.
  - Display customers in a table (sortable + basic search).
  - Edit & Delete buttons for each row.

6️⃣ UI/UX (for both Browser + VNC Desktop Preview)
- Responsive layout.
- Simple sidebar to navigate:
  - Dashboard
  - Customers
  - Logout

7️⃣ Bonus (optional if time):
- Toast popups for success/error messages.
- Confirmation modal before deleting a customer.

---------------------------------------
🔥 FINAL REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------------------

Once built, automatically:

- Run the server, ensure CORS is enabled.
- Connect frontend to backend using axios.
- Push a working full build that runs both frontend + backend in Replit.
- Provide clear instructions in README:  
  - How to run
  - How login works with Replit Auth
  - Where to test CRUD

---------------------------------------
END.
